        response: "The drawing of a squash playing squash has no formal training in chemistry or mathematics. However, it was once used as a bookmark in a Dan Brown novel, whereupon it absorbed a bit of numerology. Which Dan Brown novel you ask? The drawing of a squash playing a squash, like the rest of humanity, can't tell them apart."
